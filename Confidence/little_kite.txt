In a small toy shop, a little blue kite dreamed of flying high. But it was shy and afraid of falling.

The big kites teased, “You’re too small to soar!”

One windy afternoon, a kind girl picked the little kite. “Let’s try!” she smiled.

At first, the kite wobbled. But the wind lifted it gently, and soon—it was flying above rooftops and trees!

“I did it!” the kite shouted with joy.

From that day, it never doubted itself again.
