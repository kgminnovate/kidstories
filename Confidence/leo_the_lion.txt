Leo was a young lion in the jungle—but he never roared. He was too nervous others would laugh at him.

His friends encouraged him, but Leo stayed quiet.

One day, a baby zebra got lost in the forest. Everyone searched but couldn’t find her.

Leo climbed a tall rock, took a deep breath, and let out a loud, clear ROOOOAAAR!

The jungle stopped. The baby zebra heard him and ran toward the sound.

Everyone cheered! Leo’s roar had helped save the day—and his confidence grew louder than ever.
