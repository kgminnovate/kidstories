Alexander stood in front of thousands of soldiers. Before them lay the mighty Persian army—twice as large!

But Alexander wasn’t afraid. He rode Bucephalus and shouted, “We may be fewer, but we are stronger together!”

He formed clever battle lines and charged at the heart of the Persian army. His men followed bravely.

After hours of fighting, the Persian king Darius ran away. The Greeks had won!

This battle, called Gaugamela, showed the world that courage, teamwork, and a smart plan could win even the biggest fight.
