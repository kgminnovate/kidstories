After conquering many lands, Alexander still wasn’t done. “What’s beyond the mountains? What’s at the edge of the world?” he wondered.

He led his army through deserts, across rivers, and into new lands—places no Greek had ever seen.

In India, he met mighty elephants in battle and wise kings with peaceful hearts.

But his soldiers grew tired and wanted to go home.

Alexander, though sad, listened to them and turned back.

He didn’t find the edge of the world, but he found something greater—how to listen, lead, and dream big.
