In a sunny field of Macedonia, a wild black horse kicked and neighed fiercely. The king’s men couldn’t ride it—it was too wild! Everyone gave up, but not young Alexander.

He quietly watched the horse and realized it was scared of its own shadow. Slowly, he turned the horse’s head toward the sun, where the shadow disappeared.

Then, with calm steps, he climbed on and rode the horse like they were old friends.

Everyone clapped. His father, King Philip, smiled and said, “My son, you must find a kingdom big enough for your dreams. Macedonia is too small for you.”

The horse's name? Bucephalus. And he became Alexander’s best companion for many adventures.
