Alexander loved asking questions. “Why do stars twinkle?” “Why do people fight?” “What makes a good king?”

To help answer these, his father hired the greatest teacher in the world—Aristotle.

Every day under shady trees, Aristotle taught him science, maps, poetry, and how to think like a leader.

He told Alexander, “A strong body wins battles, but a strong mind wins hearts.”

Years later, even as a great king, Alexander still remembered his teacher’s lessons. He believed that knowledge was just as powerful as any sword.
