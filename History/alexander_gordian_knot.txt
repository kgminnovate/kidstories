In the city of Gordium, there was a famous knot tied to an old cart. People said, “Whoever unties this knot will rule all of Asia!”

Alexander looked at the thick, twisted ropes. Then, instead of untying it the normal way, he drew his sword and sliced through it with one clean cut.

“Problem solved!” he said with a smile.

Some cheered, some were shocked, but everyone remembered: Alexander didn’t wait for permission to be bold.
