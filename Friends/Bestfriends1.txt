Best Friends – Part 1: The Mini IPL and the Sleepy Surprise

Once upon a time, there were six inseparable friends: Gautham, Shiva Kumaran, Ishanth, Mithran, Praneeth, and Abishek. We did everything together—whether it was hanging out, playing games, or just chatting at our favorite spot. Wherever one of us went, the other five were never far behind.

One bright and sunny afternoon, we had a brilliant idea: “Let’s organize a mini IPL match!” We made a fun deal—whichever team lost would treat the winners with Rs. 2,000 worth of food! Everyone immediately agreed. The excitement was real.

We split into two teams.
Team CSK: Gautham, Shiva Kumaran, and Praneeth.
Team RCB: Ishanth, Mithran, and Abishek.

The game began with full energy and friendly rivalry. Boundaries were hit, wickets fell, and laughter echoed through the air. After a thrilling match, Team CSK emerged victorious! True to their word, the RCB team handed over the Rs. 2,000 for the celebration.

But we weren’t the kind to celebrate alone—we invited the RCB team too, because a win is sweeter when shared with friends. We headed to our favorite restaurant and ordered a feast: 2 chicken biryanis and 2 full grilled chickens! The food arrived piping hot, and we devoured it together while cracking jokes and reliving the funniest moments of the match. After the hearty meal, we paid the bill and returned home with full stomachs and fuller hearts.

The next morning, as usual, we all gathered at our hangout spot—except one person was missing: Praneeth. We tried calling him, but he didn’t pick up. Worried and curious, we rushed to his house. His mom told us he was still in his room, so we tiptoed in—and there he was, snoring away like a baby!

We couldn’t resist. Giggling, we poured some cold water on his face. He jumped up, shocked and confused. Once the laughter died down, we all headed back outside and decided to play football that day.

Team A: Gautham, Shiva Kumaran, and Ishanth.
Team B: Praneeth, Abishek, and Mithran.

The game was on, and our day was filled with goals, cheers, and non-stop fun.
